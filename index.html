			<p>My Dear Audience,

<br><br>To me some words are more important to write than others, and my brief personal introduction falls in that former category. My name is Vernon Zidana and I am the last born son in my African family of nine. I was born and raised in Blantyre City, Malawi, Southern Africa.

<br><br>I came to America in 2010 for my college education. I am currently studying Computer Science at The College of Wooster In Ohio. So far I like the life here in America and I thank God for giving me this opportunity.

<br><br>I designed this website as a resource that will allow me to reflect on my experiences while I am on the journey of authoring my life both inside and outside of my college classrooms. 

<br><br>I sincerely hope that you will find this website informative and exciting to surf.

<br><br>Best,

<br><br>Vernon
